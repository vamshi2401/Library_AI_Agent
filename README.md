Library AI Agent is project developed using IBM Cloud Lite services. The project aims at understanding the user query on the required book using natural language processing and responding with the suitable books
available in the library data.


The agent streamlines the process of locating relevant academic resources by:
-Extracting key academic details from student queries
-Searching from an embedded dataset
-Simulating real-time book availability
-Suggesting reservation or waitlist actions if needed
-It eliminates manual effort, enhances resource access, and improves the overall student-library experience.
